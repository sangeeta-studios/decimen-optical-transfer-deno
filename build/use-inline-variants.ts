 * Standalone builds need the worker and the wasm embedded rather than fetched.

 * Swapping the module at resolve time means the other variant is never parsed.
 *
 * `rootDir` is the repo root — passed in from vite.config.ts so the swap
 * targets stay anchored there no matter where this file lives.
