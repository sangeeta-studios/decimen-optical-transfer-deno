// Standalone variant of loaders.ts — every catalog statically imported, so a
// single downloaded file speaks all twelve languages and the bindings are
// initialized before the entry's top-level await runs (the dynamic variant,
// inlined, landed after it — a TDZ crash on open). Swapped in at resolve time
// by build/use-inline-variants.ts; the hosted build never parses this file.
